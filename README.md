# cfg-simple-calculator-wk5
Created a very simple calculator web app for my students that I teach on the Code First Girls (CFG) "Intro to Web Dev" Course.

I was limited with what I could make the calculator *do* and *how* it does it based on the lessons we'd covered so far in the course with them i.e. we've covered a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (e.g. data types, arrays, if/else statements, variables, loops, and functions). I didn't style mine as left that up to the students to add CSS as per their wishes.

Thought I'd share my source code in case others who are new to their coding journey wanted to create their own simple calculator too or any coding instructors were looking for source code for class exercises/homework -- please refer to the `homework5-instructions.md` file :)

HappyCoding;
